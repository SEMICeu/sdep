<h1>Approach</h1>

- Work technically together with actively participating EU Member States
- Work technically together with actively participating platforms
- Take shared, commonly supported design decisions
- Implement changes quick, to stay agile
- Use GitHub tags for initial versioning
- Use API versioning later (once competent authorities and platforms are connected)
